This is a set of two distinct experiments involving the K-Clustering Max-spacing algorithm incorporating the Union-Find data structure.

The first file, KC1.java, computes the max-spacing of a K-clustering given a file that represents a graph, along with nodes and edges and edge costs.

THe second file, KC2.java, involves a graph so large that the distances (edge costs) between nodes can only be represented implicitly (using Hamming distance), and computes the largest value of K such that there is a K-clustering with spacing of at least 3.

See embedded comments in each file for more information about the problem description. Upon executing each file, a number of test cases are automatically run, along with the correct solutions.
